## 1. UX

My ultimate goal is to change my career path and become a full time developer, therefore I have decided to use my first project to create my own CV website. This could be used currently as part of my own portfolio, where I can show my skills, as well as current achievements and accomplishments.

This project will show my work history and path of becoming a software developer from zero to hero ðŸ˜Š

## 1.1 Strategy

    * **Contact** button will direct you to the Contact page.

* **Hero image:**
 
    Was style to achieve multi dimensional, animation added to increase size of hero image to 1.1.

* **Title area:**

* **Personal Details:**

    Build in table form to ensure position of the text left right.

    Scale to fit most popular devices, add gray transparent background to separate form page background.

    Footers include downloadable CV under download icon.

* **Responsiveness:**

    Was checked at multiple device sizes to focus on majority of devices currently used worldwide

## 5. Development

I tried multiple layouts & elements in my second respiratory to provide the most user friendly interface. The design of the website and the content was created by myself, there was no design bots used to help with development.
I have defined responsivness break points based on precentage of the most popular devices screen size used in 2021. 
The code was reviewed multiple times to ensure all dead codes are cleaned, and it's readable for the other testers/ users. 
CSS code was cleaned and condensed (in total over 200 lines of CSS code lines were removed)
Code has been runned by HTML/ CSS beautifier to improve code outlook. 


* **All pages:**
 
During the first days of the project I did use different pictures for positioning, however I changed it later to my own picture.

Original design was with only a grey color background. I have changed that recently to provide a more complimentary photo to the hero image. Based on that, I was able to apply a grey transparent box to highlight the text section.
