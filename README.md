## 1. UX

My ultimate goal is to change my career path and become a full time developer, therefore I have decided to use my first project to create my own CV website. This could be used currently as part of my own portfolio, where I can show my skills, as well as current achievements and accomplishments.

This project will show my work history and path of becoming a software developer from zero to hero ðŸ˜Š

## 1.1 Strategy

### * Project Goals

The reason for this web page is to show my skills to potential recruiters and all who wants to cooperate with me in the future in projects. The website has been built by using HTML and CSS technologies. 

### * User Target

* 1st time Visitors who want to know more about my background and work history;
* 1st time Visitors who search for work candidates;
* 1st time Visitors who search for developers to work with.

### Returning visitors:

* Visitors who would like to continue cooperation;
* Visitors who search contact details.

### User Expectations:

* Interface is easy to navigate;
* The website is responsive across all devices (mobile, tablet and desktop);
* Content is displayed in a clear and understanding format;
* To have the ability to contact the page creator;
* Users can check my work history;
* Users can download printable CV.

## 1.2. Structure

To be able to provide for users the best experience on devices which they use, my website have responsive design to cover the majority of currently used devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/desktop). This has been tested and proven to be functional. 

* **All pages** with one consistent layout design being easy to understand and intuitive for all users;
* **Navigation bar** placed on top of the screen easily accessible even once scrolling down, visited pages are in color which matches background blue tone section, the color is defined by paint eyedropper tool;
* **Footer** with downloadable CV color tone from grey part of background picture;
* **About me** includes short about me sentence with interesting quote;
* **Resume** includes work history in chronological
* **Contact** includes contact form and google map iframe 

## 1.3. Skeleton

For creating wireframes I did use a [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), which helped me with defining layout for three types of devices (desktop, tablets and mobiles).

* **About me - homepage Wireframes:**

## 1.4. Surface

* **Typography**

As font of my choice was Poppins provided from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) in case of lack of support for Poopins font I did set sans serif font as a backup.

* **Background image**

Used background image was taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

* **Color**

Color has been defined with a paint eyedrop tool, the reason for that was to ensure consistent design with the background image. 

* **Icons**

The icons were taken from [Font Awsome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## Page details

* **Navigation Bar:**

    All buttons have text color set to grey same as borders once a site is active. After the visit this will change to sea blue color to match the background image:
    * **About me** button will direct you to the Home page.
    * **Resume** button will direct you to my work history.
    * **Contact** button will direct you to the Contact page.

* **Hero image:**
 
    Was styled to achieve a multi dimensional look,  animation added to increase the size of hero image to 1.1.

* **Title area:**

    Text was checked against typos, the font size ensured to match the most popular screen sizes. Slide in animation added to compliment hero image animation.

* **Personal Details:**

    Build in table form to ensure position of the text left right.

    Social media icons added without visual text (e.g Facebook), all icons are with active links.

* **Middle section (About me, Resume, Contact):**

    Scale to fit most popular devices, add gray transparent background to separate form page background, heading visually separate by double underline.
    Per page:
    * **About me** - short sentence with quote for visitors.
    * **Resume** - work history in easy to read form, job title automatically set to uppercase, company and time frames with underline decoration to provide clear separation from main text;
    * **Contact** - Contact form with decision point (radio buttons);
        * Buttons with green and red color in soft gray tone.

* **Footer:**

    Set to grey color to compliment the top section of the web with shadow decoration to blend with the page.

    Footers in main and all sub pages include downloadable CV under download icon.

* **Responsiveness:**

    Was checked at multiple device sizes to focus on the majority of devices currently used worldwide.

## 5. Development

I tried multiple layouts & elements in my second respiratory to provide the most user friendly interface. The design of the website and the content was created by myself, there were no design bots used to help with development.
I have defined responsive breakpoints based on the percentage of the most popular devices screen size used in 2021.

The code was reviewed multiple times to ensure all dead codes are cleaned, and it's readable for the other testers/ users.
CSS code was cleaned and condensed (in total over 200 lines of CSS code lines were removed).
Code has been runned by HTML/ CSS beautifier to improve code outlook. 


* **All pages:**
 
During the first days of the project I did use different pictures for positioning, however I changed it later to my own picture.

Original design was with only a grey color background. I have changed that recently to provide a more complimentary photo to the hero image. Based on that, I was able to apply a grey transparent box to highlight the text section.
